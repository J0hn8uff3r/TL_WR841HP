<H1>Wireless Settings Help</H1>
<p><B>Note</B>: The operating distance or range of your wireless connection varies significantly based on the physical placement of the Router. For best results, place your Router.</P>

<ul>
<lI>Near the center of the area in which your wireless stations will operate.</lI>
<lI>In an elevated location such as a high shelf.</lI>
<lI>Away from the potential sources of interference, such as PCs, microwaves, 
and cordless phones.</lI>
<lI>With the Antenna in the upright position.</lI>
<lI>Away from large metal surfaces.</lI>

</ul>
<p><B>Note</B>: Failure to follow these guidelines can result in significant performance degradation or inability to wirelessly connect to the Router.
<p><B>Wireless Network Name</B> - Enter a value of up to 32 characters. The same 
Name (SSID) must be assigned to all wireless devices in your network.</p>
<p><strong>Region</strong> - Select your region from the pull-down list. This field specifies the region where the wireless function of the Router can be used. It may be illegal to use the wireless function of the Router in a region other than one of those specified in this filed. If your country or region is not listed, please contact your local government agency for assistance.</p>
<p><B>Mode</B> - Select transmission mode according to your wireless devices. </p>
<p><B>Channel Width</B> - The bandwidth of the wireless channel.</p>
<p><B>Channel</B> - This field determines which operating frequency will be used. It is not necessary to change the wireless channel unless you notice interference problems with another nearby access point. If you select auto, then AP will choose the best channel automatically.</p>
<!--<p><B>Max Tx Rate</B> - You can limit the maximum tx rate of the Router through this field.</p>-->
<!--<p><B>Rate</B> - Max transmit data rate (It is strongly recommended that you set the rate to <B>Automatic</B>, and the Router will set the rate to the best by itself).</p>-->
<p><B>Enable Wireless Router Radio</B> - The wireless radio of the Router can 
be enabled or disabled to allow wireless stations access. If enabled, the wireless 
stations will be able to access the Router. Otherwise, wireless stations will 
not be able to access the Router.</p>
<p><B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> - If you select the <B>Enable SSID Broadcast</B> 
checkbox, the wireless router will broadcast its name (SSID) on the air. </p>
